This is my take-home assignment for an internship opportunity at B12.

I designed and implemented the front end of a functional image carousel using ruby on rails, bootstrap, javascript and HTML/CSS. The link to the HTML is the following: https://github.com/danachung3/B12/blob/master/app/views/welcome/index.html.erb.

Please clone or download this repo and run the rails app on your local host to view the functional image carousel.

Please do not hesitate to contact me with further questions.

Best, Dana Chung
